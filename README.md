# 1 OpenVario
Want to know your current altitude and upward velocity without risking your expensive variometers? Well OpenVario is for you!

Designed for aerobatic paragliding, this variometer aims to provide pilots with a way of determining their current altitude and upward velocity without risking their expensive cross country variometers from landing in the water.

# 2 Design
## 2.1 Design justifications
Originally, I wanted to use the STM32L lineup of chips for this variometer, however the global chip shortage lead to me using the ARM based RP2040 instead.
